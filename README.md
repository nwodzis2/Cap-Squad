# Night Out 1.0
### An event scheduler with a social media twist.
## Introduction
#### In today’s hectic and fast-paced world, every one of us has obligations we need to attend to. Much of our time is devoted to the workplace, education, training programs, or simply pursuing our passions. 10 hour shifts are slowly but surely replacing the tried and true 9 to 5, and the temptation of overtime pay eats into what precious little free time we have left at the end of the week. On top of that, everyone’s schedule is different, making it difficult to find quality time to spend with friends and family. While scheduling information could be conveyed to others verbally, the mind is fallible and prone to forgetfulness, and the issue only compounds upon itself the more people one associates with.
#### People are optimizing their time at work to increase productivity, yet fail to optimize their time at home to use it to its fullest potential. Night Out aims to find a solution to this problem in a way that is easy and intuitive to use, allowing friends and colleagues to connect through a familiar social-media inspired interface, visualize each other's schedules through an interactive calendar, and plan events through restaurant and venue integration.
